/**
 * '''Multiples of 3 and 5'''
 *
 * [[http://projecteuler.net/problem=1 Project Euler Problem 1]]
 *
 * If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
 * we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
 *
 * Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
 *
 * '''Solution'''
 *
 * The solution is to take the sum of multiples of 3
 * and multiples of 5 and then subtract multiples
 * and both 3 and 5, or 15.
